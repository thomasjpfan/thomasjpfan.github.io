## Technical Details About This Site

This site was built on a Python package called [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/) combined with icons from [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/). The engine displaying the math equations uses [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/). The search engine is based on [Tipue](http://www.tipue.com/search/), which searches through a static JSON file produced during site generation.
