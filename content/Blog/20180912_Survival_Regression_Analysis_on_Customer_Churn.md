Summary: In this post, we will analyze Telcon's Customer Churn Dataset and figure out what factors contribute to churn. By definition, a customer churns when they unsubscribe or leave a service. Armed with the survival function, we will calculate what is the optimum monthly rate to maximize a customers lifetime value.
